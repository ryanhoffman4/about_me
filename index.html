    <h2>About Me</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
          My name is Ryan, and I am the proud owner of two cats.  My Meyers-Briggs type is INTP, and naturally I love learning how to code.  Some of my hobbies are cooking, swimming, and playing chess.  My favorite thing to cook has been Italian cuisine.  I can make a mean lasagna, as well as pasta carbonara.  As far as I know, I'm not allergic to anything.  Also, Han Solo shot first.

    <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        I have several random STEM university course under my belt, and I will finish a general studies degree in Math and Applied Tech in December 2021.  Currently, I am loving this journey at Code Fellows and am pushing hard to become a professional software engineer.  I have applied for an internship in Eastern Washington and, along with this bootcamp, hope to collect work experience that way.   
      </p>
    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        So far, most of my work experience has been in food service. Since I was 16, I have worked in several fancy restaurants, spending the most time at The Black Cypress, a renowned Greek bar and grill in Pullman, Washington.  Since my resume is all food service, I appreciate the Code Fellows Career Coaching assignments to help buff my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Resume with code projects.  
      </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        My goals are simple.  By the end of the 2021 year I would like to have a college degree, bootcamp certification, an internship, and healthy social media accounts with projects to showcase. This should be a strong foundation for landing a tech job.  I would also like to get back in shape by the end of summer.  Covid has had me putting on the pounds! As a side project, I am also collecting books to build a personal library of noteworthy information and literature.  This is a slow work in progress; I hardly have any time to read for enjoyment until the end of my schooling.
